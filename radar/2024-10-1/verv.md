**VERV DAO** is a voluntary movement that merges psychology, philosophy, self-sustainability, and technology into a unified philosophy. We advocate for the rights of libertarians and digital nomads. Our mission is to develop an ecosystem of internal products that empower individuals with tools and provide the necessary context and environment for self-sustainability. VERV is currently building digital products, including a non-custodial wallet, a bridge between TON and TRON networks, governance and DAO platforms.
