**Blockchain State: Chuvashia Volga-Bulgaria**. Developing functions: Our citizens [can elect representatives](https://t.me/bulcoin_blc/24) through the blockchain. Resolve conflicts in [private courts](https://telegra.ph/Sudebnaya-sistema-v-CHuvashii---Volzhskoj-Bulgarii-07-20) with a blockchain reputation. The economy is supported by the BulCoin-BLC, which is minted every month to the budget of the [elected Council](https://x.com/ChuvashiaGov). The council uses the budget to expand the community. For example, through a [mini-app](https://t.me/bulcoin_blc/29) with freelance services. Freelance requires art, and this allows integrating the private court system. Citizens will be able to receive not only NFT passports, but also paper [foreign passports](https://t.me/bulcoin_blc/25).
